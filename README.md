# Solutions

Hi! I will be updating this directory with solutions to all the problem sets! If you want to download and run them you should go up there take the link and then in your terminal do

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PullenClasses/problem-set-solutions.git
cd problem-set-solutions
```

When this is updated you can get the new solutions using

```bash
cd problem-set-solutions
git stash
git stash drop
git pull
```

I hope this helps!
